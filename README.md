#### What I did
* I used devise for authentification because it allows to have a secure login.
* I created the possibility to create an organizations by signing up.
* I created the node model.
* I have added the ancestry gem that allows to create a tree structure.


#### What I wish I had time to do
* Dive deeper in the ancestry gem: I should have added it to the organization model.
* Go further in the parent - child relationship.
* Put more links to add, remove, edit nodes.
* Anticipate more for future developments of the app (JS).
* Change the URLs for the organization to see only its name and no id.
